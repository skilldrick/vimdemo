VIM DEMO
========

An HTML5 showcase of Vim's awesome editing capabilities.

This app will display Vim commands in action, so the viewer can get a feel for
Vim's awesomeness. Vim commands will be written in modular JavaScript, so new ones can be easily added.

A [demo is available here](http://vimdemo.skilldrick.co.uk/).
